# The Center for Artificial Intelligence & Computational Neuropathology

## Crary Lab - Computational Pathology and AI

Welcome to the Crary Lab's Computational Pathology and AI repository. We are a dedicated research group at Mount Sinai, focusing on the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuropathology.

## About Us

At the Crary Lab, our mission is to harness the power of AI to advance our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. Our work primarily involves:

- **Histoage Prediction:** Developing algorithms to estimate tissue age based on histopathological data.
- **Tauopathy Classification:** Building and testing foundational models for accurately classifying various tauopathy cases.
- **Data-Driven Research:** Utilizing large datasets to identify molecular markers and their relevance in neurodegenerative disease progression.

## Get Involved

We welcome collaborations and contributions from the scientific community. If you're interested in our work or want to contribute, feel free to reach out or explore our repositories.
